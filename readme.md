# quadigit-phat
Rust library for the Pimoroni Four Letter pHAT

This library aims to port [fourletter-phat](https://github.com/pimoroni/fourletter-phat) driver with 'some' of it's methods into rust, while taking advantage of rusts type features.

As this library is in it's very early stages of development don't expect anything to remain until some release on crates.io.

Issues and pull requests are welcome.

The driver ___was___ an extension of: [ht16k33](https://github.com/jasonpeacock/ht16k33) (or rather a fork, as of right now) so credit goes to [Jason Peacock](https://github.com/jasonpeacock) and other contributors.

Now it's an extension of: [ht16k33-diet](https://github.com/sesar54/ht16k33-diet.git)
