# quadigit-phat
Rust library for the Pimoroni Four Letter pHAT

This library aims to port [fourletter-phat](https://github.com/pimoroni/fourletter-phat) driver with most of it's methods into rust, while taking advantage of rusts type features.

As this library is in it's very early stages of development don't expect anything to remain until release on crates.io.

Issues and pull requests are welcome.
